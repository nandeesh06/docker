Why Docker Exist?
Before Docker, we often ran into issues like:

1. "It works on my machine" syndrome
Code might work perfectly on a developer's computer but fail in testing or production due to different environments, library versions, or OS configurations.

2. Complex setups
Setting up a new environment could take hours or days â€” installing the right versions of Python, Node, databases, etc.

3. Heavy virtual machines (VMs)
VMs isolate apps well but are slow, large, and resource-hungry (they each need their own OS).

4. Difficult deployment and scaling
Moving apps from development to production was error-prone, inconsistent, and hard to automate.


How it slove the problem?
